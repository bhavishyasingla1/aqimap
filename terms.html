                <h2>📊 Data Accuracy & Limitations</h2>
                <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date air quality information, you acknowledge and agree
                    that:</p>

                <h3>Data Sources</h3>
                <p>All AQI data is sourced from third-party providers, primarily the World Air Quality Index (WAQI)
                    project. We do not operate our own environmental monitoring equipment. The accuracy, timeliness, and
                    availability of data depend entirely on these external sources and their monitoring networks.</p>

                <h3>No Warranty of Accuracy</h3>
                <p>We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of the air
                    quality data displayed on AQIMap.fun. Data may be delayed, incorrect, or unavailable due to factors
                    beyond our control including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitoring station equipment failures or calibration errors</li>
                    <li>Network outages or API service interruptions</li>
                    <li>Data transmission delays or corruption</li>
                    <li>Lack of monitoring infrastructure in certain regions</li>
                    <li>Rapid changes in local air quality conditions</li>
                </ul>

                    conversions, while based on scientific research, are simplified approximations and should not
                    replace guidance from qualified healthcare providers.</p>

                <p>Always consult with your doctor or other qualified health professional regarding any questions about
                    air pollution exposure, especially if you have pre-existing respiratory conditions, cardiovascular
                    disease, or other health concerns.</p>
