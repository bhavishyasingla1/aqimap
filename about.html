                <h2>🌍 What is AQIMap.fun?</h2>
                <p>AQIMap.fun is a cutting-edge, interactive web platform designed to democratize access to real-time
                    air quality information across the globe. Unlike traditional environmental monitoring tools that
                    present data in complex scientific formats, we transform air quality index (AQI) readings into
                    intuitive, visual representations that anyone can understand at a glance.</p>

                <p>Our platform covers over 195 countries worldwide, aggregating data from thousands of environmental
                    monitoring stations to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date air quality information
                    available. Whether you're planning your daily commute, considering a vacation destination, or
                    researching global pollution trends, AQIMap.fun delivers the insights you need in a beautiful,
                    easy-to-navigate interface.</p>

                <p>The air quality index is more than just a number—it's a critical health indicator that affects
                    billions of people every day. At AQI Map.fun, we believe that everyone deserves to know what they're
                    breathing, and we're committed to making that information as accessible as checking the weather
                    forecast.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental health challenges of our time, responsible
                    for millions of premature deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. Yet, many
                    people remain unaware of the air quality in their immediate environment or how it compares to other
                    regions worldwide.</p>

                <p>Our mission at AQIMap.fun is threefold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Raise Awareness:</strong> By visualizing air quality data on an interactive world map
                        with real-time color-coded indicators, we make pollution levels immediately visible and
                        understandable to everyone, regardless of their scientific background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Empower Action:</strong> Knowledge is power. When people understand the air quality in
                        their area, they can make informed decisions about outdoor activities, exercise routines, travel
                        plans, and even long-term decisions about where to live and work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drive Change:</strong> By making air pollution data transparent and accessible, we hope
                        to inspire individuals, communities, and policymakers to take meaningful action toward cleaner
                        air and a healthier planet.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We envision a world where checking air quality is as routine as checking the weather, where clean air
                    is recognized as a fundamental human right, and where data-driven awareness leads to collective
                    action for environmental improvement.</p>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>💡 What Makes AQIMap.fun Different?</h2>
                <p>In a crowded field of air quality monitoring tools, AQIMap.fun stands out through several innovative
                    features and design philosophies:</p>

                <h3>Cigarette Equivalents - Making AQI Relatable</h3>
                <p>Traditional AQI numbers (0-500) can feel abstract. What does an AQI of 150 really mean for your
                    health? We solve this by converting AQI values into cigarette equivalents based on Berkeley Earth's
                    research. When you see that breathing the air in a city is equivalent to smoking 2.5 cigarettes per
                    day, the health impact becomes immediately clear and personal.</p>

                <h3>Real-Time Global Coverage</h3>
                <p>Unlike regional or city-specific air quality apps, AQIMap.fun provides a bird's-eye view of air
                    pollution across the entire planet. Our integration with the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) project
                    gives us access to data from over 12,000 monitoring stations in 1,000+ cities across 195+ countries,
                    updated in real-time.</p>

                <h3>Premium, Intuitive Design</h3>
                <p>We believe that important environmental data deserves a beautiful presentation. Our
                    glassmorphism-inspired interface, smooth animations, and color-coded visual system make exploring
                    air quality data not just informative but genuinely enjoyable. The platform features both light and
                    dark modes, ensuring comfortable viewing at any time of day.</p>

                <h3>Zero Barriers to Entry</h3>
                <p>No sign-up required. No app installation needed. No complicated dashboards to navigate. Just visit
                    aqimap.fun, click on any country, and instantly see its air quality status. We've optimized the
                    platform to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, making air quality data
                    accessible wherever you are.</p>

                <h3>SEO-Optimized Country Pages</h3>
                <p>Each country on AQIMap.fun has its own dedicated URL (like aqimap.fun/india or
                    aqimap.fun/united-states), making it easy to share specific air quality information and helping
                    people discover regional data through search engines.</p>

                <h3>Client-Side Routing</h3>
                <p>The platform uses client-side routing to create SEO-friendly URLs for every country without requiring
                    page reloads. This means you can share a link like aqimap.fun/brazil, and the recipient will
