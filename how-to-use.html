                <h2>🚬 What Are Cigarette Equivalents?</h2>
                <p>One of AQIMap.fun's most powerful features is our cigarette equivalent calculator. We convert
                    abstract AQI numbers into a relatable metric that everyone can understand: the number of cigarettes
                    you'd need to smoke to experience similar health effects.</p>

                <p>This conversion is based on research from <strong>Berkeley Earth</strong>, which established that
                    breathing air with an AQI of 22 for 24 hours has similar health impacts to smoking one cigarette.
                    Using this scientifically validated ratio, we calculate:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Cigarettes/Day = AQI ÷ 22</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Real-World Examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Delhi, India (AQI 250):</strong> Breathing Delhi's air is like smoking 11.4 cigarettes
                        per day</li>
                    <li><strong>Beijing, China (AQI 160):</strong> Equivalent to smoking 7.3 cigarettes per day</li>
                    <li><strong>Los Angeles, USA (AQI 88):</strong> Equivalent to smoking 4.0 cigarettes per day</li>
                    <li><strong>Stockholm, Sweden (AQI 15):</strong> Equivalent to smoking 0.7 cigarettes per day</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This metric makes the invisible danger of air pollution visceral and personal. Most people wouldn't
                    consider smoking 10 cigarettes a day healthy—yet millions of people breathe air of equivalent
                    toxicity without realizing it. AQIMap.fun brings this reality into sharp focus.</p>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>📊 Data Types: Real-Time vs. Historical</h2>
                <p>AQIMap.fun prioritizes showing you real-time air quality data whenever possible. For most countries
                    and major cities, we display current AQI values updated every hour from thousands of global
                    monitoring stations through the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) network.</p>

                <p>However, real-time monitoring infrastructure doesn't exist everywhere. For countries or regions
                    lacking active monitoring stations, we provide <strong>2-year historical averages</strong> to ensure
                    comprehensive global coverage. When viewing historical data, you'll see a small badge in the popup
                    indicating "Based on 2-year average data."</p>

                <p>This hybrid approach means you can explore air quality trends for every country on Earth—from heavily
                    monitored regions like North America and Europe to developing nations where monitoring is
                    sparse—while always knowing the freshness and reliability of the data you're viewing.</p>

                <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>How often is the data updated?</h3>
                <p>Real-time data from the WAQI network updates every hour for most monitoring stations, with some
                    high-traffic locations updating as frequently as every 15 minutes. AQIMap.fun caches data for 30
                    minutes to balance freshness with performance, so you're never seeing data older than 30 minutes for
                    real-time locations.</p>

                <h3>Why doesn't my country show real-time data?</h3>
                <p>Real-time air quality monitoring requires physical monitoring stations that measure pollutant levels.
                    Many developing countries lack this infrastructure. In these cases, we provide 2-year historical
                    averages so you can still get a sense of typical air quality conditions.</p>

                <h3>Can I see city-level data instead of country-level?</h3>
                <p>Currently, AQIMap.fun shows country-level averages calculated from all available monitoring stations
                    within that country. City-level granularity is on our development roadmap and will be added in a
                    future update.</p>

                <h3>Is AQIMap.fun free to use?</h3>
                <p>Yes! AQIMap.fun is completely free with no ads, no registration requirements, and no hidden costs. We
                    believe air quality information is a public health necessity that should be accessible to everyone.
                </p>

                <h3>Does AQIMap.fun work on mobile devices?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. The platform is fully responsive and works beautifully on smartphones and tablets. Simply
                    visit aqimap.fun in your mobile browser—no app installation required.</p>

                <h3>How accurate is the cigarette equivalent calculation?</h3>
                <p>The conversion is based on peer-reviewed research from Berkeley Earth that established the PM2.5
                    exposure equivalency between ambient air pollution and cigarette smoking. While the exact health
                    impact varies based on individual factors (age, existing conditions, exposure duration), the 1:22
                    ratio (1 cigarette ≈ AQI of 22) is widely accepted in scientific literature.</p>
