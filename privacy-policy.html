                <h2>🔒 Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
                <p>At AQIMap.fun, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when
                    you use our real-time global air quality monitoring platform. The short version: <strong>we don't
                        collect, store, or sell your personal information</strong>. We believe that monitoring air
                    pollution shouldn't require sacrificing your digital privacy.</p>

                <p>This policy applies to all users of aqimap.fun, regardless of geographic location, and is designed to
                    comply with international privacy regulations including GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), and other
                    data protection frameworks worldwide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>📊 Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
                <p>Unlike most websites and web applications, AQIMap.fun is designed to function without collecting any
                    personally identifiable information (PII). Specifically, we do NOT collect:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Email Addresses:</strong> There's no registration, no newsletter signup, no account
                        system</li>
                    <li><strong>Names or Contact Information:</strong> We don't ask for or store your name, phone
                        number, or mailing address</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We don't track your physical location through GPS, IP
                        geolocation, or any other means</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> AQIMap.fun is completely free with no premium features, so
                        we never handle credit cards or payment details</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Tracking:</strong> We don't use tracking pixels, fingerprinting, or
                        cross-site cookies to follow your browsing habits</li>
                    <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> There's no sign-up system, so we have no user databases with
                        your personal information</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can use AQIMap.fun completely anonymously. We have no way to identify you personally or link your
                    usage to your real-world identity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>💾 Local Storage (Browser-Side Data)</h2>
                <p>While we don't collect data on our servers, AQIMap.fun does store minimal information locally in your
                    web browser to enhance your experience. This data never leaves your device and is under your
                    complete control. Specifically, we store:</p>

                <h3>Theme Preference</h3>
                <p>When you toggle between light and dark mode, your preference is saved to your browser's localStorage
                    under the key <code>aqi-theme</code>. This ensures the site remembers your visual preference on
                    future visits. You can clear this at any time through your browser's settings.</p>

                <h3>AQI Data Cache</h3>
                <p>To provide instant responses and reduce unnecessary API calls, we temporarily cache air quality data
                    in your browser's memory (sessionStorage) for up to 30 minutes. This cache is automatically cleared
                    when you close the browser tab and contains only anonymized AQI values and country names—no personal
                    data.</p>

                <h3>How to Clear Local Data</h3>
                <p>You can delete all localStorage data at any time by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chrome/Edge:</strong> Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear Browsing Data → Cookies
                        and other site data</li>
                    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Clear Data</li>
                    <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data → Remove All</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🌐 Third-Party Services</h2>

                <h3>World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API</h3>
                <p>AQIMap.fun retrieves real-time air quality data from the World Air Quality Index project (aqicn.org)
                    through their public API. When you click on a country, your browser makes a direct request to WAQ
                    I's servers to fetch current AQI data. This request includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The country or city name you're searching for</li>
                    <li>Our API token (not associated with individual users)</li>
                    <li>Standard HTTP headers (browser type, IP address - handled by WAQI, not us)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>WAQI maintains its own privacy policy governing how they handle API requests. We recommend reviewing
                    their policy at <a href="https://aqicn.org/privacy/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">https://aqicn.org/privacy/</a>.</p>

                <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
                <p>AQIMap.fun uses Google Fonts to load the Inter typeface for improved typography. When you visit our
                    site, your browser downloads font files from Google's servers, which may log your IP address. We use
                    the <code>display=swap</code> parameter to prevent render-blocking and improve privacy. Google
                    Fonts' privacy policy is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

                <h3>D3.js Library</h3>
                <p>Our interactive map uses the D3.js visualization library, which we host locally on our servers. No
                    external requests are made to load D3, ensuring this library doesn't introduce privacy concerns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🍪 Cookies</h2>
                <p>AQI Map.fun does NOT use cookies. Instead, we rely on browser localStorage (as described above) which
                    provides similar functionality without the tracking concerns associated with traditional cookies.
                    LocalStorage data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never gets sent to our servers or any third parties</li>
                    <li>Persists only until you clear your browser data</li>
                    <li>Is inaccessible to other websites due to same-origin policy</li>
                    <li>Cannot be used for cross-site tracking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You won't see any cookie consent banners on aqimap.fun because there's nothing to consent to—we
                    simply don't use cookies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>📈 Analytics & Tracking</h2>
                <p>Currently, AQIMap.fun does NOT use any analytics services like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar
                    platforms. We intentionally avoid these tools to protect your privacy. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don't track which pages you visit</li>
                    <li>We don't monitor how long you spend on the site</li>
                    <li>We don't record your clicks, scrolls, or interactions</li>
                    <li>We don't build user profiles or behavioral segments</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We may add privacy-respecting analytics in the future (such as server-side, anonymized aggregated
                    statistics) to understand usage patterns and improve the platform. If we do, this policy will be
                    updated with full disclosure, and you'll be notified via a banner on the site.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🌍 International Users</h2>
                <p>AQIMap.fun is accessible worldwide and we welcome users from all countries. Our platform is hosted in
                    the United States, but since we don't collect personal data, there are no cross-border data transfer
                    concerns. The minimal localStorage data we use stays entirely on your device and never crosses
                    international boundaries.</p>

                <p>Users in the European Union benefit from GDPR protections, though there's minimal personal data to
                    protect. California residents are covered by CCPA, but again, we have no personal information to
                    share or sell. Regardless of your location, you have complete control over any data stored locally
                    in your browser.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>👶 Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>AQIMap.fun is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any
                    personal information, use of our platform doesn't raise COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection
                    Act) concerns. Parents and educators are welcome to use aqimap.fun as an educational tool to teach
                    children about air quality and environmental awareness without privacy risks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🔐 Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we don't collect personal data, we still take security seriously for the platform itself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All communication between your browser and aqimap.fun is
                        encrypted via TLS/SSL</li>
                    <li><strong>No Server-Side Storage:</strong> We don't maintain user databases that could be breached
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Limited API Keys:</strong> Our WAQI API token is rate-limited and can only fetch air
                        quality data, not modify anything</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Source Transparency:</strong> Our code is available for security review (GitHub
                        repository link on About page)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>🔄 Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>If we make significant changes to how we handle data (for example, adding analytics or new features
                    that require data processing), we will:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Update this Privacy Policy with a new "Last Updated" date</li>
                    <li>Display a notification banner on aqimap.fun highlighting the changes</li>
                    <li>Provide a summary of what changed and why</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We will never retroactively change our privacy practices without notice. Historical versions of this
                    policy may be available through the Web Archive or by contacting us directly.</p>

                <p>We aim to respond to privacy inquiries within 7-14 business days. Since we don't collect personal
                    data, most common requests (data deletion, access requests, etc.) are already fulfilled by
