                <h2>📊 Data Accuracy & Reliability</h2>

                <h3>Third-Party Data Sources</h3>
                <p>All air quality index (AQI) values displayed on AQIMap.fun are sourced from external third-party
                    providers, primarily the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) project. We do NOT independently verify,
                    measure, or validate this datainternal monitoring equipment. We act solely as a data aggregator and
                    visualization platform.</p>

                <p>The accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and reliability of air quality data depend entirely on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Source Monitoring Stations:</strong> The calibration, maintenance, and operational
                        status of physical air quality monitoring equipment operated by government agencies and
                        environmental organizations worldwide</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> The reliability of communication networks transferring data
                        from monitoring stations to centralized databases</li>
                    <li><strong>API Availability:</strong> The uptime and performance of third-party APIs (primarily
                        WAQI) that we query for real-time data</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional Coverage:</strong> The density and distribution of monitoring stations, which
                        varies dramatically by country and region</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Potential Inaccuracies</h3>
                <p>You should be aware that the air quality data displayed on AQIMap.fun may be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outdated:</strong> Real-time data typically updates hourly but may be delayed by network
                        issues or station downtime</li>
                    <li><strong>Geographically Limited:</strong> Country-wide averages may not reflect localized
                        pollution hotspots or clean zones within that country</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonally Variable:</strong> Historical averages don't account for seasonal
                        fluctuations (e.g., wildfire season, agricultural burning periods)</li>
                    <li><strong>Incomplete:</strong> Some countries have sparse monitoring coverage, leading to less
                        reliable average calculations</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Equipment malfunctions, calibration errors, or data transmission
                        glitches can produce erroneous readings</li>
                </ul>

                <p> We make reasonable efforts to display data accurately as provided by our sources, but we cannot
                    guarantee correctness. <strong>Always cross-reference critical air quality information with official
                        government sources or local environmental agencies before making important health
                        decisions.</strong></p>

                <h2>🏥 Not Medical or Health Professional Advice</h2>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The information provided through AQIMap.fun, including AQI values,
                    cigarette equivalents, color-coded severity levels, and any health-related descriptions, does NOT
                    constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. Our Service is an educational
                    tool only.</p>

                <h3>Consult Healthcare Professionals</h3>
                <p>If you have concerns about how air pollution may affect your health—particularly if you have
                    pre-existing conditions such as asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, allergies, or pregnancy—you
                    MUST consult with qualified healthcare providers including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your primary care physician or doctor</li>
                    <li>Pulmonologists (lung specialists) for respiratory concerns</li>
                    <li>Cardiologists for heart-related questions</li>
                    <li>Allergists for pollution-triggered allergies</li>
                    <li>Pediatricians for childrenrelated air quality concerns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cigarette Equivalent Limitations</h3>
                <p>The cigarette equivalent calculations on AQIMap.fun are simplified approximations based on Berkeley
                    Earth's research comparing PM2.5 exposure from ambient air pollution to active cigarette smoking.
                    These conversions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do NOT account for individual factors like age, weight, lung capacity, or existing health
                        conditions</li>
                    <li>Assume 24-hour continuous exposure to the stated AQI level</li>
                    <li>Focus primarily on PM2.5 particulate matter and don't account for other pollutants (ozone, NO2,
                        SO2, CO)</li>
                    <li>Use a linear conversion ratio (AQI ÷ 22) that may not perfectly match actual health impacts</li>
                    <li>Serve as educational analogies to make abstract AQI numbers relatable, not precise medical
                        equivalencies</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Use these cigarette equivalents as rough guidelines for understanding relative pollution severity,
                    not as precise health risk calculations.</p>

                <p>AQIMap.fun is provided free of charge as a passion project maintained by a single developer. As such:
                </p>

                <h3>No Uptime Guarantees</h3>
                <p>We do NOT guarantee continuous, uninterrupted access to the Service. The website may experience
                    downtime due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Server maintenance or upgrades</li>
                    <li>Hosting provider outages</li>

                <h2>🌍 Geographic & Temporal Variations</h2>
                <p>Air quality is highly variable across both space and time. The AQI values displayed on AQIMap.fun
                    represent point-in-time snapshots or historical averages and may not reflect:</p>

                <h3>Micro-Local Variations</h3>
                <p>Air quality can vary dramatically within short distances. A monitoring station in downtown may show
                    high pollution while a nearby park has much cleaner air. Country-level or even city-level averages
                    cannot capture these micro-local variations. If you live near highways, industrial facilities,
                    construction sites, or other pollution sources, your actual exposure may differ significantly from
                    the displayed values.</p>

                <h3>Rapid Changes</h3>
                <p>Air quality can change quickly due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather events (wind dispersion, rain washout, temperature inversions)</li>
                    <li>Wildfires, dust storms, or volcanic eruptions</li>
                    <li>Traffic patterns and rush hour timing</li>
                    <li>Industrial emissions variability</li>
                    <li>Agricultural burning activities</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The data you see on AQIMap.fun may be outdated by the time you view it, especially during rapidly
                    changing conditions. For time-sensitive decisions, check more frequently updated sources.</p>

                <h3>Historical Data Limitations</h3>
                <p>For locations without real-time monitoring, we display 2-year historical averages. These averages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't reflect recent trends or improvements/deteriorations in air quality</li>
